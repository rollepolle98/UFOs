# UFO Webpage

## Background and Overview

During the asynchronous part of the module , the webpage and dynamic table were working as intended but unfortunately it was not too in depth. So I was tasked with creating a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. More in Depth meaning that I was tasked in creating a site that allowed users to fikter for multiple criteria at the same time. For example being able to filter by city,date, state, country and shape.

## Results

So the way the site works is fairly simple, when it is first loaded up it is completely unfiltered. You have the ability to look through every single entry. 

### Unflitered

After seeing the unfiltered page , we can then take a look at the filtered page below where we were able to filter by Date, City, State, Country and even Shape of the sighting.
