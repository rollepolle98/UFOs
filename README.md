# UFO Webpage

## Background and Overview

During the asynchronous part of the module , the webpage and dynamic table were working as intended but unfortunately it was not too in depth. So I was tasked with creating a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. More in Depth meaning that I was tasked in creating a site that allowed users to fikter for multiple criteria at the same time. For example being able to filter by city,date, state, country and shape.

## Results
